It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning. NLTK also provides wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries and an active discussion forum."

# Split the document into sentences
