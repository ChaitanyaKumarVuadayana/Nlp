# Sample paragraph
paragraph = "NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries, and an active discussion forum."

# Tokenize the paragraph into words
words = nltk.word_tokenize(paragraph)

# Calculate frequency distribution
freq_dist = FreqDist(words)

# Print each word along with its frequency
for i, j in freq_dist.items():
    print(f"Word: {i}, Frequency: {j}")
