# Sample document
document = "NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning. NLTK also provides wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries and an active discussion forum."

# Tokenize the document into individual words

# Tag each tokenized word with its part of speech

# Print the parts of speech
